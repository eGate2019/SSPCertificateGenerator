We are responsible for the development and maintenance of specifications for Secure Elements (SEs) in a multi-application capable environment, 
the integration into such an environment, as well as the secure provisioning of services making use of SEs.

Our work includes the development and maintenance of specifications for the SE and its interface to the outside world for use in telecommunication systems,
for general telecommunication purposes as well as for Machine-to-Machine (M2M)/Internet of Things (IoT) communications.
The committeeâ€™s work comprises the interface,
procedures and protocol specifications between the SE and entities (remote or local) used in its management. It also includes interfaces, 
procedures and protocol specifications used between such entities for the secure provisioning and operation of services making use of the SE.
